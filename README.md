#  Housing Affordability in New Brunswick (2022â€“2024)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes rental housing trends in New Brunswick between 2022 and 2024. By comparing average rent across unit types (Bachelor, 1BR, 2BR, 3+BR) with after-tax household income, we assess whether housing is still affordable across key cities like Fredericton, Moncton, and Bathurst.

##  Goals
- Track rent trends across different cities and bedroom types
- Evaluate affordability based on the 30% rent-to-income benchmark
- Identify which regions remain accessible for singles, couples, and families
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize insights

## Tools Used
- Tableau (for dashboard and data visualization)
- Excel (for preprocessing)
- StatsCan and CMHC data sources

- Several cities now exceed the 30% rent-to-income affordability threshold
- Smaller cities like Bathurst still offer affordable housing options
